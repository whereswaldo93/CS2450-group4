### Vision Statement:

- Describe the “why” of the project.
    - This project aims to empower students to take control of their academic workload by transforming overwhelming task lists into clear, actionable steps that support success and well-being.

- Mention target users, pain points, and core value.
     - Students would be the target user
     - Possible pain points could be:
        - Cognitive Overload; long, cluttered lists can seem overwhelming
        - Poor Prioritization; everything feels like equal priority, possibly leading users to feel like they don't know what to work on next
        - Forgetting Tasks; poorly timed reminders or lack of
        - Friction & Overcomplexity; too many features, steps or tags
        - Lack of Motivation; no sense of progress and checking off tasks doesn't feel rewarding enough to use the app
    - The core value is to help users reliably remember, priortize, and complete tasks to stay on top of their academic workload.

### Timeline:

- Follow the course syllabus schedule;
    - Milestone 1: Project Initiation and Setup, February 9
    - Milestone 2: Requirements Engineering and MVP Development. February 23
    - Milestone 3: System Modeling and Architecture Implementation, March 9
    - Milestone 4: Advanced Features and Integration, March 30
    - Milestone 5: Testing and Refactoring, April 6
    - Project Presentation, April 10
    - Final Submission, April 21

### Risks:

- Identify at least 3 risks (e.g., missed deadlines, scope creep) and their mitigation strategies.
1. Scope creep
   - Begin with the MVP construction
2. Missed deadlines
   - Having all roles help out where needed
3. Communication issues
   - Meet weekly for atleast an hour with an additional scrum meeting
4. Limited testing that leads to insufficient features

### Other Elements(if any):

- Include any other relevant information that will guide your project.

- Example: Market Opportunities, competitive analysis, etc.
