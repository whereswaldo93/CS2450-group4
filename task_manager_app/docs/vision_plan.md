### Vision Statement:

- Describe the “why” of the project.
    - Organize types of tasks using categories and priorities

- Mention target users, pain points, and core value.
     - Students would be the target user
     - Possible pain points could be:
        - Cognitive Overload; long, cluttered lists can seem overwhelming
        - Poor Prioritization; everything feels like equal priority, possibly leading users to feel like they don't know what to work on next
        - Forgetting Tasks; poorly timed reminders or lack of
        - Friction & Overcomplexity; too many features, steps or tags
        - Lack of Motivation; no sense of progress and checking off tasks doesn't feel rewarding enough to use the app
     *The core value is to help users reliably remember, priortize, and complete tasks to stay on top of their academic workload.
  
- Focusing on college students through the help of task and time management. Intuitive user UI so that the app saves time. 

### Timeline:

- List major milestones with tentative deadlines.

- Example: “Feature freeze by Week 5, testing phase by Week 7.”

### Risks:

- Identify at least 3 risks (e.g., missed deadlines, scope creep) and their mitigation strategies.
1. Scope creep
   - Begin with the MVP construction
2. Missed deadlines
   - Having all roles help out where needed
3. Communication issues
   - Meet weekly for atleast an hour with an additional scrum meeting
4. Limited testing that leads to insufficient features

### Other Elements(if any):

- Include any other relevant information that will guide your project.

- Example: Market Opportunities, competitive analysis, etc.
