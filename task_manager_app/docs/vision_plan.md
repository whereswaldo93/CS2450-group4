- Focusing on college students through the help of task and time management. Intuitive user UI so that the app saves time. 

### Timeline:

   - Begin with the MVP construction
2. Missed deadlines
   - Having all roles help out where needed
3. Communication issues
   - Meet weekly for atleast an hour with an additional scrum meeting
4. Limited testing that leads to insufficient features
